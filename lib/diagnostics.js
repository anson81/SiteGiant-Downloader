/**
 * The report a user copies when something goes wrong on a machine nobody can see.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS.
 *
 * Every bug this extension has had was diagnosed by asking someone to describe
 * what they saw, and the descriptions were wrong more often than not - not
 * because anyone was careless, but because the useful facts are invisible from
 * the front. "It downloaded 9 out of 10" turned out to be a healthy run whose
 * check was reading the wrong download. "The files went loose into Downloads"
 * turned out to be another extension answering Chrome about our files.
 *
 * The extension already knew every one of those facts at the time. They sat in
 * chrome.storage.local on someone else's PC and never reached anyone who could
 * read them, so each was rediscovered from scratch, twice.
 *
 * This turns them into text on the clipboard.
 *
 * DESIGN NOTES.
 *
 * Plain text, not JSON. It gets pasted into a chat window by a person, and a
 * person should be able to read what they are sending before they send it.
 *
 * Pure and synchronous: every input is passed in, including the clock. That is
 * what makes it testable at all - see tools/test-diagnostics.js - and it means
 * this file cannot be the reason a report fails to appear.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the network. The transport is the user's clipboard, on
 * purpose: they can see it, and it cannot reach anywhere they did not paste it.

   * that is kept. Masking the name means the report can be forwarded without a
   * second thought.
   *
   * Windows, macOS and Linux each spell it differently, so all three are
   * handled rather than the one the developer happens to be sitting at.
